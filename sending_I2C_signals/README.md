## Design Project 2 - Part 1
#### Using I2C2 on the BeagleBone Black board (BBB) to send a signal through SDA and SCL lines. The SDA and SCl lines are connected to a PCA9685, which would then return an ACK when it has successfully received the signals. 
#### To ensure internal BBB intializations are done correctly, we will also connect the SDA and SCL lines to an oscilloscope to check the I2C bus traffic.
